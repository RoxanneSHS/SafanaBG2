style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The flirting thief from the Sword Coast is one of the NPCs that have been given a significant overhaul in the Enhanced Edition and she has become an interesting character in the Dragonspear expansion. Sadly the original game gives her a disappointing ending at the end of that campaign.

This mod alters the SoD ending for Safana and lets her continue with the party in Amn and Tethir.

Features:

- a continuous NPC for the complete EET game
- a continued romance for a male player
- several smaller quests throughout BG2
- some alternative solutions to a number of game quests that lets the player make use of her talents
- a possibilty for a player who is not thief to get the MaeVar stronghold with Safana in party
- interjections and banters throughout the game
- the chance to get a talented thief early in Amn, Safana can be found right with Gaelan Bayle
- a new ending to the Coran relationship
