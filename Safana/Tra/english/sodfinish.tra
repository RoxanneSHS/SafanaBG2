@0    = ~Darling, things NEVER look easy with you - with us, if I might say.~
@1    = ~A skull and tears burnt into stone around you. A girl dead at your feet, her blood on your hands, her soul gone. Your side is a risky place to be, isn't it?~
@2    = ~No risk no fun. I've known it when I let you be the thief stealing my heart.~
@3    = ~I'm glad you did, Safana.~
@4    = ~I'm sure I know what you'd do if I were in there.~
@5    = ~Cheering you up? I think I succeed already.~
@6    = ~Listen, darling, I only do what you'd do if I were in there. It's Imoen and me and other friends who will get you out of here soon. Say nothing. Just keep your faith just like we keep faith in you.~
@7    = ~Hush, I need to go before this gets all melodramatically silly. See you soon - without iron bars.~
